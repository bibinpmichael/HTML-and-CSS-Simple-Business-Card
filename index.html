<!-- 

The HTML document begins with the <html> tag, which encapsulates the entire content of the webpage. Within this, we have two main sections: the <head> and the <body>.
The <head> section contains metadata about the document and links to external resources. In this case, we have a single <link> tag that connects our HTML file to an external CSS file named "styles.css". This separation of structure (HTML) and presentation (CSS) is a fundamental principle of modern web development, allowing for easier maintenance and reusability of styles across multiple pages.
Moving to the <body> section, we find the visible content of our webpage. The main component is a <div> element with the class "card". This div acts as a container for our business card content. Inside this card, we have an <img> element with the class "avatar", which will display a profile picture. The src attribute points to an image file named "per.png" located in an "images" directory.
Following the image, we have another <div> that contains the textual information of the business card. This includes:

        An <h3> element with the name "Tom Davidson"
        A <p> element describing the job title "Fullstack Developer"
        An <h4> element stating the location "California, USA"

This structure allows for a clear hierarchy of information, with the name being the most prominent (h3), followed by the job title, and then the location. The use of semantic HTML elements (<h3>, <p>, <h4>) not only provides structure to the content but also aids in accessibility and SEO.
